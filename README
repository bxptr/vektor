a mini vector database implementation that intends to be educational and interpretable

many current vector database implementations are focused on monetization and open source
implementations tend to be quite sprawling. a vector database is not a complex project 
and this implementation of the core concepts is done ridiculously small. of course, currently,
this is a bare-bones version, and I will add more production-level concepts to the project
as time goes on.

currently, the implementation uses BERT for the embeddings model and euclidean distance for the
similarity measure and brute forces the best vectors by iterating through them all and ranking
by similarity. this was just to make a MVP of sorts and I have plans to make this somewhat
functional.

needless to say, the implementation did not come intuitively and I referenced the following sources:

1. https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-database/
2. https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-similarity/

* yes i too find it hilarous that i referenced a vector database provider to make a vector database *
