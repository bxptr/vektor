a mini vector database implementation that intends to be educational and interpretable

many current vector database implementations are focused on monetization and open source
implementations tend to be quite sprawling. a vector database is not a complex project 
and this implementation of the core concepts is done ridiculously small. of course, currently,
this is a bare-bones version, and I will add more production-level concepts to the project
as time goes on. 

needless to say, the implementation did not come intuitively and I referenced the following sources:

1. https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-database/
2. https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vector-similarity/

* yes i too find it hilarous that i referenced a vector database provider to make a vector database *

some notes and ideas as well as general comments can be found in `notes`
