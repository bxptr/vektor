notes
-----

* just making sense of what a vector database is and algorithms *

index algo: RP (random projection) or LSH (locality-sensitive hashing)
similarity algo: dot product (for RP) or eucldean (for LSH)
filtering: post-filtering

search:
    1. embedding fn/model
    2. rank based on similarity
    3. filter

insert: pass through embeddings and store as np array

embeddings: fse, OpenAI, or BERT
fse does not work on a macbook and I am not falling prey to OpenAI so BERT it is
